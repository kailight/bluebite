## Developer Notes

I am not a React developer, I used Vue on 90% of my projects. I dislike React because of JSX

In Vue I use PUG as HTML preprocessor and Stylus as CSS preprocessor, so I can write CSS way faster while using advanced features.

There's no simple way to use PUG or Stylus preprocessor with React, so I had to resort with plain JSX and SCSS.

I do not like the idea of CSS-in-JS, as it mixes concepts. So I do not use CSS modules.

For same reason of mixing concepts, I do not to use Tailwind and its family frameworkds.
